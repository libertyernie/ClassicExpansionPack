You can launch the Classic Expansion Pack in "omega stages only" mode using Riivolution. That's what these files are for.

The files that get used in omega-only mode are defined in /riivolution/ocarina.xml.

STGBATTLEFIELD.pac is the Omega Battlefield from SSB4 by Edwguard Flows, from here: http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=211673 (Brawl optimized version).
